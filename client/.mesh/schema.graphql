  Return the list of available destinations, zones and grouping zones. 
  
  Destinations are the highest level entities in our destination tree by which availability can be searched. Please note that destination codes are not IATA codes. It is very important to understand that our 'destination' will not always only correspond with a unique city, but usually with the main city and the area surrounding the city. 
  
  For example, the destination code NYC in the US, corresponds with the whole New York Area, so it is not limited to the city of New York, but also covers the surrounding areas, such as New Jersey and The Hamptons. Another example is BCN in Spain, which corresponds with the entire Barcelona Province; so it searches hotels located in the city of Barcelona, but also in other cities within the Province of Barcelona, such us Hospitalet de Llobregat, Terrassa and Sabadell. So when you search for availability using the destination code, you will receive results that may be located far from the main city for which you are actually searching.
  
  It is very important to check the locations that the search retrieves to avoid booking hotels in a different location than the one requested by your customers.

  The Reconfirmation operation allows to retrieve the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client when requested in a GET call to our endpoint.
  
  Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an __asynchronous__ service: **reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking**, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this operation.
  
  The Reconfirmation operation offers a wide variety of filters to help narrowing down reconfirmation number results. Only one filter can be used at the same time. Below the four possible filters you can use:
  
  * between two cheking dates
  * between two reconfirmation dates
  * list of clientReference ids
  * list of booking Ids
  
  ## Reconfirmation Service
  
  Additionally we offer you the capacity to receive the reconfirmation numbers automatically in our reconformation service, designed to automatically send you the reconfirmation information as soon as is available from the hoteliers in two different ways:
  
  * [Push Service](/documentation/hotels/booking-api/reconfirmation-service/push-service/) : The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
  * [Email Service](/documentation/hotels/booking-api/reconfirmation-service/email-service/): The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.

  CheckRate is an _optional_ operation used to assess and valuate the rate before the actual booking. CheckRate returns the same information as the Availability response for a hotel rate with up-to-date price, along with additional information regarding the rate: rate breakdown, rate comments and upselling options.
  
  The CheckRate method can complement the booking process, as it returns additional information to the availability request. However, when the rateType value is 'RECHECK', the CheckRate method is mandatory.
  
  Besides the details for the rate, CheckRate has the option to also return information of higher rates of the same hotel being checked. This is called Upselling.
  
  Upselling returns additional room options, each with its own rate key, allowing you to upgrade the stay quality in room category and rate plan even after the CheckRate operation has been performed.
