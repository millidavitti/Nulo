  Return the list of available destinations, zones and grouping zones. 
  
  Destinations are the highest level entities in our destination tree by which availability can be searched. Please note that destination codes are not IATA codes. It is very important to understand that our 'destination' will not always only correspond with a unique city, but usually with the main city and the area surrounding the city. 
  
  For example, the destination code NYC in the US, corresponds with the whole New York Area, so it is not limited to the city of New York, but also covers the surrounding areas, such as New Jersey and The Hamptons. Another example is BCN in Spain, which corresponds with the entire Barcelona Province; so it searches hotels located in the city of Barcelona, but also in other cities within the Province of Barcelona, such us Hospitalet de Llobregat, Terrassa and Sabadell. So when you search for availability using the destination code, you will receive results that may be located far from the main city for which you are actually searching.
  
  It is very important to check the locations that the search retrieves to avoid booking hotels in a different location than the one requested by your customers.
